            <p>
            sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.
            </p>

            <p>
            sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP. See the PLUGINS section for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
            The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific; the default password prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is 5 minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
            Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to run sudo again for a period of time without requiring authentication. The sudoers policy caches credentials for 5 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5). By running sudo with the -v option, a user can update the cached credentials without running a command.
            </p>

            <p>
            When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied.
            </p>

            <p>
            Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use sudo. If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may be logged as well.
            </p>

            <p>
            The options are as follows:
            </p>

            <p>
            -A'            Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read itfrom the user's terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option isspecified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executedto read the user's password and output the password to thestandard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable isset, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise,if /etc/sudo.conf contains a line specifying the askpassprogram, that value will be used.  For example:
            </p>

            <p>
            # Path to askpass helper program
            Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
            </p>

            <p>
            If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with an error.
            </p>

            <p>
            -b'            The -b (background) option tells sudo to run the givencommand in the background.  Note that if you use the -boption you cannot use shell job control to manipulate theprocess.  Most interactive commands will fail to workproperly in background mode.
            </p>

            <p>
            -C fd' Normally, sudo will close all open file descriptors other than standard input, standard output and standard error. The -C (close from) option allows the user to specify a starting point above the standard error (file descriptor three). Values less than three are not permitted. The security policy may restrict the user's ability to use the -C option. The sudoers policy only permits use of the -C option when the administrator has enabled the closefrom_override option.
            </p>

            <p>
            -E' The -E (preserve environment) option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their existing environment variables. The security policy may return an error if the -E option is specified and the user does not have permission to preserve the environment.
            </p>

            <p>
            -e' The -e (edit) option indicates that, instead of running a command, the user wishes to edit one or more files. In lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting the security policy. If the user is authorized by the policy, the following steps are taken:
            </p>

            <p>
            1. Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner set to the invoking user.
            </p>

            <p>
            2. The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary files. The sudoers policy uses the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables (in that order). If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, the first program listed in the editor sudoers(5) option is used.
            </p>

            <p>
            3. If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to their original location and the temporary versions are removed.
            </p>

            <p>
            If the specified file does not exist, it will be created. Note that unlike most commands run by sudo, the editor is run with the invoking user's environment unmodified. If, for some reason, sudo is unable to update a file with its edited version, the user will receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary file.
            </p>

            <p>
            -g group' Normally, sudo runs a command with the primary group set to the one specified by the password database for the user the command is being run as (by default, root). The -g (group) option causes sudo to run the command with the primary group set to group instead. To specify a gid instead of a group name, use #gid. When running commands as a gid, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a backslash ('\'). If no -u option is specified, the command will be run as the invoking user (not root). In either case, the primary group will be set to group.
            </p>

            <p>
            -H' The -H (HOME) option requests that the security policy set the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the target user (root by default) as specified by the password database. Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
            -h' The -h (help) option causes sudo to print a short help message to the standard output and exit.
            </p>

            <p>
            -i [command]
            The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user as a login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option. If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed. sudo attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell. The security policy shall initialize the environment to a minimal set of variables, similar to what is present when a user logs in. The Command Environment section in the sudoers(5) manual documents how the -i option affects the environment in which a command is run when the sudoers policy is in use.
            </p>

            <p>
            -K' The -K (sure kill) option is like -k except that it removes the user's cached credentials entirely and may not be used in conjunction with a command or other option. This option does not require a password. Not all security policies support credential caching.
            </p>

            <p>
            -k [command]
            When used alone, the -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates the user's cached credentials. The next time sudo is run a password will be required. This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file. Not all security policies support credential caching.
            </p>

            <p>
            When used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require a password, the -k option will cause sudo to ignore the user's cached credentials. As a result, sudo will prompt for a password (if one is required by the security policy) and will not update the user's cached credentials.
            </p>

            <p>
            -l[
            l] [command]
            If no command is specified, the -l (list) option will list the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user (or the user specified by the -U option) on the current host. If a command is specified and is permitted by the security policy, the fully-qualified path to the command is displayed along with any command line arguments. If command is specified but not allowed, sudo will exit with a status value of 1. If the -l option is specified with an l argument (i.e. -ll), or if -l is specified multiple times, a longer list format is used.
            </p>

            <p>
            -n' The -n (non-interactive) option prevents sudo from prompting the user for a password. If a password is required for the command to run, sudo will display an error message and exit.
            </p>

            <p>
            -P' The -P (preserve group vector) option causes sudo to preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered. By default, the sudoers policy will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the target user is in. The real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.
            </p>

            <p>
            -p prompt
            The -p (prompt) option allows you to override the default password prompt and use a custom one. The following percent ('%') escapes are supported by the sudoers policy:
            </p>

            <p>
            %H
            expanded to the host name including the domain name (on if the machine's host name is fully qualified or the fqdn option is set in sudoers(5))
            </p>

            <p>
            %h
            expanded to the local host name without the domain name
            </p>

            <p>
            %p
            expanded to the name of the user whose password is being requested (respects the rootpw, targetpw, and runaspw flags in sudoers(5))
            </p>

            <p>
            %U
            expanded to the login name of the user the command will be run as (defaults to root unless the -u option is also specified)
            </p>

            <p>
            %u
            expanded to the invoking user's login name
            </p>

            <p>
            %%
            two consecutive '%' characters are collapsed into a single '%' character
            </p>

            <p>
            The prompt specified by the -p option will override the system password prompt on systems that support PAM unless the passprompt_override flag is disabled in sudoers.
            </p>

            <p>
            -r role' The -r (role) option causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the role specified by role.
            </p>

            <p>
            -S' The -S (stdin) option causes sudo to read the password from the standard input instead of the terminal device. The password must be followed by a newline character.
            </p>

            <p>
            -s [command]
            The -s (shell) option runs the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified in the password database. If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell's -c option. If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
            </p>

            <p>
            -t type' The -t (type) option causes the new (SELinux) security context to have the type specified by type. If no type is specified, the default type is derived from the specified role.
            </p>

            <p>
            -U user' The -U (other user) option is used in conjunction with the -l option to specify the user whose privileges should be listed. The security policy may restrict listing other users' privileges. The sudoers policy only allows root or a user with the ALL privilege on the current host to use this option.
            </p>

            <p>
            -u user' The -u (user) option causes sudo to run the specified command as a user other than root. To specify a uid instead of a user name, #uid. When running commands as a uid, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a backslash ('\'). Security policies may restrict uids to those listed in the password database. The sudoers policy allows uids that are not in the password database as long as the targetpw option is not set. Other security policies may not support this.
            </p>

            <p>
            -V' The -V (version) option causes sudo to print its version string and the version string of the security policy plugin and any I/O plugins. If the invoking user is already root the -V option will display the arguments passed to configure when sudo was built and plugins may display more verbose information such as default options.
            </p>

            <p>
            -v' When given the -v (validate) option, sudo will update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user's password if necessary. For the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to by the security policy) but does not run a command. Not all security policies support cached credentials.
            </p>

            <p>
            --' The -- option indicates that sudo should stop processing command line arguments.
            </p>

            <p>
            Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed on the command line in the form of VAR=value, e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pkg/lib. Variables passed on the command line are subject to the same restrictions as normal environment variables with one important exception. If the setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden. See sudoers(5) for more information.
